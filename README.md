# RAF ML homework 1

First homework for Machine Learning course.

## TensorBoard Usage

First, run this command:

> tensorboard --logdir logs/

This should print that TensorBoard has started. Next, connect to **http://localhost:6006**.
TensorBoard requires a `logdir` to read logs from. For info on configuring TensorBoard, run `tensorboard --help`.
